# Problem :
 City officials have a number of questions on the City Bike Project to be able to take data-driven action.
 And the goal of this data analytics project is to build a set of data reports to provide their questions answers.

# Data Source: https://citibikenyc.com/system-data

# Task : 
- Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report. 
- Dump data to database (SQL, MongoDB, MySQL)
- Connect with the stakeholders and try to get the understanding of the data attribute
- Connect with the business user and try to get the understanding about the KPI (Key performance indicator)
  **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)** is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives
- Connect with the business user with raw visualization and gather user experience and expectations feedback based on ease of use 
- Decide total number of dashboards based on user hierarchy and organization 
- Start building production-based dashboard and story

# KPI which need to be captured :
- How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
- By what percentage has total ridership grown?
- How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
- How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?
- How does the average trip duration change by age?
- What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
- Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
- How variable is the utilization by bike ID?
